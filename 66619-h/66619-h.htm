<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>For this Anthology I have tried to range over the whole field of English
Verse from the beginning, or from the Thirteenth Century to this closing
year of the Nineteenth, and to choose the best. Nor have I sought in
these Islands only, but wheresoever the Muse has followed the tongue
which among living tongues she most delights to honour. To bring home
and render so great a spoil compendiously has been my capital
difficulty. It is for the reader to judge if I have so managed it as to
serve those who already love poetry and to implant that love in some
young minds not yet initiated.</p>

<p>My scheme is simple. I have arranged the poets as nearly as possible in
order of birth, with such groupings of anonymous pieces as seemed
convenient. For convenience, too, as well as to avoid a dispute-royal, I
have gathered the most of the Ballads into the middle of the Seventeenth
Century; where they fill a languid interval between two winds of
inspiration&mdash;the Italian dying down with Milton and the French following
at the heels of the restored Royalists. For convenience, again, I have
set myself certain rules of spelling. In the very earliest poems
inflection and spelling are structural, and to modernize is to destroy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>But as old inflections fade into modern the old spelling becomes less
and less vital, and has been brought (not, I hope, too abruptly) into
line with that sanctioned by use and familiar. To do this seemed wiser
than to discourage many readers for the sake of diverting others by a
scent of antiquity which&mdash;to be essential&mdash;should breathe of something
rarer than an odd arrangement of type. But there are scholars whom I
cannot expect to agree with me; and to conciliate them I have excepted
Spenser and Milton from the rule.</p>

<p>Glosses of archaic and otherwise difficult words are given at the foot
of the page: but the text has not been disfigured with reference-marks.
And rather than make the book unwieldy I have eschewed
notes&mdash;reluctantly when some obscure passage or allusion seemed to ask
for a timely word; with more equanimity when the temptation was to
criticize or ‘appreciate.’ For the function of the anthologist includes
criticizing in silence.</p>

<p>Care has been taken with the texts. But I have sometimes thought it
consistent with the aim of the book to prefer the more beautiful to the
better attested reading. I have often excised weak or superfluous
stanzas when sure that excision would improve; and have not hesitated to
extract a few stanzas from a long poem when persuaded that they could
stand alone as a lyric. The apology for such experiments can only lie in
their success: but the risk is one which, in my judgement, the
anthologist ought to take. A few small corrections have been made, but
only when they were quite obvious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span></p>

<p>The numbers chosen are either lyrical or epigrammatic. Indeed I am
mistaken if a single epigram included fails to preserve at least some
faint thrill of the emotion through which it had to pass before the
Muse’s lips let it fall, with however exquisite deliberation. But the
lyrical spirit is volatile and notoriously hard to bind with
definitions; and seems to grow wilder with the years. With the
anthologist&mdash;as with the fisherman who knows the fish at the end of his
sea-line&mdash;the gift, if he have it, comes by sense, improved by practice.
The definition, if he be clever enough to frame one, comes by
after-thought. I don’t know that it helps, and am sure that it may
easily mislead.</p>

<p>Having set my heart on choosing the best, I resolved not to be dissuaded
by common objections against anthologies&mdash;that they repeat one another
until the proverb δὶς ἢ τρὶς τὰ καλά loses all application&mdash;or perturbed
if my judgement should often agree with that of good critics. The best
is the best, though a hundred judges have declared it so; nor had it
been any feat to search out and insert the second-rate merely because it
happened to be recondite. To be sure, a man must come to such a task as
mine haunted by his youth and the favourites he loved in days when he
had much enthusiasm but little reading.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Few of my contemporaries can erase&mdash;or would wish to erase&mdash;the dye
their minds took from the late Mr. Palgrav<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span>e’s <i>Golden Treasury</i>: and he
who has returned to it again and again with an affection born of
companionship on many journeys must remember not only what the <i>Golden
Treasury</i> includes, but the moment when this or that poem appealed to
him, and even how it lies on the page. To Mr. Bullen’s <i>Lyrics from the
Elizabethan Song Books</i> and his other treasuries I own a more advised
debt. Nor am I free of obligation to anthologies even more recent&mdash;to
Archbishop Trench’s <i>Household Book of Poetry</i>, Mr. Locker-Lampson’s
<i>Lyra Elegantiarum</i>, Mr. Miles’ <i>Poets and Poetry of the Century</i>, Mr.
Beeching’s <i>Paradise of English Poetry</i>, Mr. Henley’s <i>English Lyrics</i>,
Mrs. Sharp’s <i>Lyra Celtica</i>, Mr. Yeats’ <i>Book of Irish Verse</i>, and Mr.
Churton Collins’ <i>Treasury of Minor British Poetry</i>: though my rule has
been to consult these after making my own choice. Yet I can claim that
the help derived from them&mdash;though gratefully owned&mdash;bears but a
trifling proportion to the labour, special and desultory, which has gone
to the making of my book.</p>

<p>For the anthologist’s is not quite the <i>dilettante</i> business for which
it is too often and ignorantly derided. I say this, and immediately
repent; since my wish is that the reader should in his own pleasure
quite forget the editor’s labour, which too has been pleasant: that,
standing aside, I may believe this book has made the Muses’ access
easier when, in the right hour, they come to him to uplift or to
console&mdash;</p>

particularly for allowing me to insert the latest emendations in Lord

Carman; to Mr. John Lane for two poems by William Brighty Rands; to the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge for two extracts from
Christina Rossetti’s <i>Verses</i>; and to Mr. Bertram Dobell, who allows me
not only to select from James Thomson but to use a poem of Traherne’s, a
seventeenth-century singer rediscovered by him. To mention all who in
other ways have furthered me is not possible in this short Preface;
which, however, must not conclude without a word of special thanks to
Dr. W. Robertson Nicoll for many suggestions and some pains kindly
bestowed, and to Professor F. York Powell, whose help and wise counsel
have been as generously given as they were eagerly sought, adding me to
the number of those many who have found his learning to be his friends’
good fortune.</p>

<h3>Phyllida’s Love-Call</h3>

<pre>
    <i>Phyllida.</i> Corydon, arise, my Corydon!
                  Titan shineth clear.
     <i>Corydon.</i> Who is it that calleth Corydon?
                  Who is it that I hear?
        <i>Phyl.</i> Phyllida, thy true love, calleth thee,
                  Arise then, arise then,
                    Arise and keep thy flock with me!
         <i>Cor.</i> Phyllida, my true love, is it she?
                  I come then, I come then,
                    I come and keep my flock with thee.

         <i>Phyl.</i> Here are cherries ripe for my Corydon;
                  Eat them for my sake.
          <i>Cor.</i> Here’s my oaten pipe, my lovely one,
                  Sport for thee to make.

        <i>Phyl.</i> Here are threads, my true love, fine as silk,
                  To knit thee, to knit thee,
                    A pair of stockings white as milk.
         <i>Cor.</i> Here are reeds, my true love, fine and neat,
                  To make thee, to make thee,
                    A bonnet to withstand the heat.

        <i>Phyl.</i> I will gather flowers, my Corydon,
                  To set in thy cap.
         <i>Cor.</i> I will gather pears, my lovely one,
                  To put in thy lap.
        <i>Phyl.</i> I will buy my true love garters gay,
                  For Sundays, for Sundays,
                    To wear about his legs so tall.
         <i>Cor.</i> I will buy my true love yellow say,
                  For Sundays, for Sundays,
                    To wear about her middle small.

        <i>Phyl.</i> When my Corydon sits on a hill
                  Making melody&mdash;
         <i>Cor.</i> When my lovely one goes to her wheel,
                  Singing cheerily&mdash;
        <i>Phyl.</i> Sure methinks my true love doth excel
                  For sweetness, for sweetness,
                    Our Pan, that old Arcadian knight.
         <i>Cor.</i> And methinks my true love bears the bell
                  For clearness, for clearness,
                    Beyond the nymphs that be so bright.

        <i>Phyl.</i> Had my Corydon, my Corydon,
                  Been, alack! her swain&mdash;
         <i>Cor.</i> Had my lovely one, my lovely one,
                  Been in Ida plain&mdash;

    <i>Phyl.</i> Cynthia Endymion had refused,
              Preferring, preferring,
                My Corydon to play withal.
     <i>Cor.</i> The Queen of Love had been excused
              Bequeathing, bequeathing,
                My Phyllida the golden ball.

    <i>Phyl.</i> Yonder comes my mother, Corydon!
              Whither shall I fly?
     <i>Cor.</i> Under yonder beech, my lovely one,
              While she passeth by.
    <i>Phyl.</i> Say to her thy true love was not here;
              Remember, remember,
                To-morrow is another day.
     <i>Cor.</i> Doubt me not, my true love, do not fear;
              Farewell then, farewell then!
                Heaven keep our loves alway!

<h3>Ulysses and the Siren</h3>

<pre>
      <i>Siren.</i> Come, worthy Greek! Ulysses, come,
                 Possess these shores with me:
               The winds and seas are troublesome,
                 And here we may be free.
               Here may we sit and view their toil
                 That travail in the deep,
               And joy the day in mirth the while,
                 And spend the night in sleep.

    <i>Ulysses.</i> Fair Nymph, if fame or honour were
                 To be attain’d with ease,
               Then would I come and rest me there,
                 And leave such toils as these.
               But here it dwells, and here must I
                 With danger seek it forth:
               To spend the time luxuriously
                 Becomes not men of worth.

      <i>Siren.</i> Ulysses, O be not deceived
                 With that unreal name;
               This honour is a thing conceived,
                 And rests on others’ fame:
               Begotten only to molest
                 Our peace, and to beguile
               The best thing of our life&mdash;our rest,
                 And give us up to toil.

    <i>Ulysses.</i> Delicious Nymph, suppose there were
                 No honour nor report,
               Yet manliness would scorn to wear
                 The time in idle sport:
               For toil doth give a better touch
                 To make us feel our joy,
               And ease finds tediousness as much
                 As labour yields annoy.

      <i>Siren.</i> Then pleasure likewise seems the shore
                 Whereto tends all your toil,
               Which you forgo to make it more,
                 And perish oft the while.
               Who may disport them diversely
                 Find never tedious day,
               And ease may have variety
                 As well as action may.

    <i>Ulysses.</i> But natures of the noblest frame
                 These toils and dangers please;
               And they take comfort in the same
                 As much as you in ease;
               And with the thought of actions past
                 Are recreated still:
               When Pleasure leaves a touch at last
                 To show that it was ill.

      <i>Siren.</i> That doth <i>Opinion</i> only cause
                 That’s out of <i>Custom</i> bred,
               Which makes us many other laws
                 Than ever <i>Nature</i> did.
               No widows wail for our delights,
                 Our sports are without blood;
               The world we see by warlike wights
                 Receives more hurt than good.

    <i>Ulysses.</i> But yet the state of things require
                 These motions of unrest:
               And these great Spirits of high desire
                 Seem born to turn them best:
               To purge the mischiefs that increase
                 And all good order mar:
               For oft we see a wicked peace
                 To be well changed for war.

      <i>Siren.</i> Well, well, Ulysses, then I see
                 I shall not have thee here:
               And therefore I will come to thee,
                 And take my fortune there.
               I must be won, that cannot win,
                 Yet lost were I not won;
               For beauty hath created been
                 T’ undo, or be undone.

<h3>A Dialogue</h3>

<pre>
    <i>Man.</i> Sweetest Saviour, if my soul
            Were but worth the having,
          Quickly should I then control
            Any thought of waving.
          But when all my care and pains
          Cannot give the name of gains
          To Thy wretch so full of stains,
          What delight or hope remains?

    <i>Saviour.</i> What, child, is the balance thine,
               Thine the poise and measure?
             If I say, ‘Thou shalt be Mine,’
               Finger not My treasure.
             What the gains in having thee
             Do amount to, only He
             Who for man was sold can see
             That transferr’d th’ accounts to Me.

    <i>Man.</i> But as I can see no merit
            Leading to this favour,
          So the way to fit me for it
            Is beyond my savour.
          As the reason, then, is Thine,
          So the way is none of mine;
          I disclaim the whole design;
          Sin disclaims and I resign.

    <i>Saviour.</i> That is all: if that I could
               Get without repining;
             And My clay, My creature, would
               Follow My resigning;

<h3>To a Mistress Dying</h3>

<pre>
    <i>Lover.</i> Your beauty, ripe and calm and fresh
              As eastern summers are,
            Must now, forsaking time and flesh,
              Add light to some small star.

    <i>Philosopher.</i> Whilst she yet lives, were stars decay’d,
                    Their light by hers relief might find;
                  But Death will lead her to a shade
                    Where Love is cold and Beauty blind.

    <i>Lover.</i> Lovers, whose priests all poets are,
              Think every mistress, when she dies,
            Is changed at least into a star:
              And who dares doubt the poets wise?

    <i>Philosopher.</i> But ask not bodies doom’d to die
                    To what abode they go;
                  Since Knowledge is but Sorrow’s spy,
                    It is not safe to know.

<span class="i0">And now the Sun had stretch’d out all the hills,<br /></span>

I had, my Country&mdash;am I to be blamed?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, when I think of thee, and what thou art,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Verily, in the bottom of my heart,<br />
Of those unfilial fears I am ashamed.<br />
For dearly must we prize thee; we who find<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; In thee a bulwark for the cause of men;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I by my affection was beguiled:<br />
What wonder if a Poet now and then,<br />
Among the many movements of his mind,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Felt for thee as a lover or a child!

<h3>The Solitary Reaper</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
Behold her, single in the field,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Yon solitary Highland Lass!<br />
Reaping and singing by herself;<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  Stop here, or gently pass!<br />
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,<br />
And sings a melancholy strain;<br />
O listen! for the Vale profound<br />
Is overflowing with the sound.<br />
No Nightingale did ever chaunt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;   More welcome notes to weary bands<br />
Of travellers in some shady haunt,<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  Among Arabian sands:<br />
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard<br />
In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,<br />
Breaking the silence of the seas<br />
Among the farthest Hebrides.<br />
Will no one tell me what she sings?&mdash;<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br />
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;   And battles long ago:<br />
Or is it some more humble lay,<br />
Familiar matter of to-day?<br />
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,<br />
That has been, and may be again?<br />
Whatever the theme, the Maiden sang<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  As if her song could have no ending;<br />
I saw her singing at her work,<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  And o'er the sickle bending;&mdash;<br />
I listen'd, motionless and still;<br />
And, as I mounted up the hill,<br />
The music in my heart I bore,<br />
Long after it was heard no more.

<h3>Ode</h3>

<p class="dttsml"><i>Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood</i></p>

<pre>
    There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
        The earth, and every common sight,
                  To me did seem
        Apparell’d in celestial light,
    The glory and the freshness of a dream,
    It is not now as it hath been of yore;&mdash;
              Turn wheresoe’er I may,
                  By night or day,
    The things which I have seen I now can see no more.
            The rainbow comes and goes,
            And lovely is the rose;
            The moon doth with delight
        Look round her when the heavens are bare;
            Waters on a starry night
            Are beautiful and fair;
        The sunshine is a glorious birth;
        But yet I know, where’er I go,
    That there hath pass’d away a glory from the earth.

    Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
        And while the young lambs bound
            As to the tabor’s sound,
    To me alone there came a thought of grief:
    A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
            And I again am strong:
    The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
    No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
    I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,
    The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
            And all the earth is gay;
                Land and sea
        Give themselves up to jollity,
          And with the heart of May
        Doth every beast keep holiday;&mdash;
              Thou Child of Joy,
    Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!

    Ye blessèd creatures, I have heard the call
        Ye to each other make; I see
    The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
        My heart is at your festival,
          My head hath its coronal,
    The fullness of your bliss, I feel&mdash;I feel it all.
            O evil day! if I were sullen
            While Earth herself is adorning,
                This sweet May-morning,
            And the children are culling
                On every side,
            In a thousand valleys far and wide,
            Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
    And the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm:&mdash;
            I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
         &mdash;But there’s a tree, of many, one,
    A single field which I have look’d upon,
    Both of them speak of something that is gone:
            The pansy at my feet
            Doth the same tale repeat:
    Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
    Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

    Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
    The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star,
            Hath had elsewhere its setting,
              And cometh from afar:
            Not in entire forgetfulness,
            And not in utter nakedness,
    But trailing clouds of glory do we come
            From God, who is our home:
    Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
    Shades of the prison-house begin to close
            Upon the growing Boy,
    But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,
            He sees it in his joy;
    The Youth, who daily farther from the east
        Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,
          And by the vision splendid
          Is on his way attended;
    At length the Man perceives it die away,
    And fade into the light of common day.

    Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
    Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
    And, even with something of a mother’s mind,
            And no unworthy aim,
        The homely nurse doth all she can
    To make her foster-child, her inmate Man,
        Forget the glories he hath known,
    And that imperial palace whence he came.

    Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
    A six years’ darling of a pigmy size!
    See, where ’mid work of his own hand he lies,
    Fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses,
    With light upon him from his father’s eyes!
    See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
    Some fragment from his dream of human life,
    Shaped by himself with newly-learnèd art;
        A wedding or a festival,
        A mourning or a funeral;
            And this hath now his heart,
        And unto this he frames his song:
            Then will he fit his tongue
    To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
            But it will not be long
            Ere this be thrown aside,
            And with new joy and pride
    The little actor cons another part;
    Filling from time to time his ‘humorous stage’
    With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
    That Life brings with her in her equipage;
            As if his whole vocation
            Were endless imitation.

    Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
            Thy soul’s immensity;
    Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep
    Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind,
    That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep,
    Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,&mdash;
            Mighty prophet! Seer blest!
            On whom those truths do rest,
    Which we are toiling all our lives to find,
    In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
    Thou, over whom thy Immortality
    Broods like the Day, a master o’er a slave,
    A presence which is not to be put by;
                To whom the grave
    Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
              Of day or the warm light,
    A place of thought where we in waiting lie;
    Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might
    Of heaven-born freedom on thy being’s height,
    Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
    The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
    Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
    Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,
    And custom lie upon thee with a weight,
    Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!
            O joy! that in our embers
            Is something that doth live,
            That nature yet remembers
            What was so fugitive!
    The thought of our past years in me doth breed
    Perpetual benediction: not indeed
    For that which is most worthy to be blest&mdash;
    Delight and liberty, the simple creed
    Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,
    With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:&mdash;
            Not for these I raise
            The song of thanks and praise;
        But for those obstinate questionings
        Of sense and outward things,
        Fallings from us, vanishings;
        Blank misgivings of a Creature
    Moving about in worlds not realized,
    High instincts before which our mortal Nature
    Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
            But for those first affections,
            Those shadowy recollections,
          Which, be they what they may,
    Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
    Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
    Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
    Our noisy years seem moments in the being
    Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,
                  To perish never:
    Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,
                  Nor Man nor Boy,
    Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
    Can utterly abolish or destroy!
        Hence in a season of calm weather
            Though inland far we be,
    Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
            Which brought us hither,
        Can in a moment travel thither,
    And see the children sport upon the shore,
    And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.

    Then sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!
            And let the young lambs bound
            As to the tabor’s sound!
    We in thought will join your throng,
          Ye that pipe and ye that play,
          Ye that through your hearts to-day
          Feel the gladness of the May!
    What though the radiance which was once so bright
    Be now for ever taken from my sight,
        Though nothing can bring back the hour
    Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
          We will grieve not, rather find
          Strength in what remains behind;
          In the primal sympathy
          Which having been must ever be;
          In the soothing thoughts that spring
          Out of human suffering;
          In the faith that looks through death,
    In years that bring the philosophic mind.

    And O ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,
    Forebode not any severing of our loves!
    Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
    I only have relinquished one delight
    To live beneath your more habitual sway.
    I love the brooks which down their channels fret,
    Even more than when I tripp’d lightly as they;
    The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
                  Is lovely yet;
    The clouds that gather round the setting sun
    Do take a sober colouring from an eye
    That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;
    Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
    Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
    Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
    To me the meanest flower that blows can give
    Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

<h3>Desideria</h3>
<pre>
Surprised by joy&mdash;impatient as the Wind
  I turned to share the transport&mdash;O! with whom
  But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb,
That spot which no vicissitude can find?
Love, faithful love, recall'd thee to my mind&mdash;
  But how could I forget thee? Through what power,
  Even for the least division of an hour,
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind
To my most grievous loss?&mdash;That thought's return
  Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,
Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,
  Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more;
That neither present time, nor years unborn
  Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.

                But there is play, I sadly fear,
                And song I would not have you hear.

    <i>Alciphron.</i> To you may none of them repeat
                The play that you have play’d with me,
                The song that made your bosom beat.

<span class="i0">A thing to do, and all her hair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And I untighten’d next the tress<br /></span>
<span class="i2">About her neck; her cheek once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blush’d bright beneath my burning kiss:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I propp’d her head up as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only, this time my shoulder bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head, which droops upon it still:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The smiling rosy little head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So glad it has its utmost will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That all it scorn’d at once is fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I, its love, am gain’d instead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Porphyria’s love: she guess’d not how<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her darling one wish would be heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus we sit together now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all night long we have not stirr’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet God has not said a word!<br /></span>

<h3>Departure</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="letra">I</span>T was not like your great and gracious ways!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you, that have naught other to lament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never, my Love, repent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how, that July afternoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sudden, unintelligible phrase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frighten’d eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon your journey of so many days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a single kiss, or a good-bye?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew, indeed, that you were parting soon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so we sate, within the low sun’s rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You whispering to me, for your voice was weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your harrowing praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, it was well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear you such things speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I could tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What made your eyes a growing gloom of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a warm South-wind sombres a March grove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it was like your great and gracious ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn your talk on daily things, my Dear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_911" id="page_911">{911}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting the luminous, pathetic lash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let the laughter flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst I drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all at once to leave me at the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More at the wonder than the loss aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With huddled, unintelligible phrase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frighten’d eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And go your journey of all days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With not one kiss, or a good-bye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the only loveless look the look with which you pass’d:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="letra">M</span>Y little Son, who look’d from thoughtful eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having my law the seventh time disobey’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I struck him, and dismissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hard words and unkiss’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;His Mother, who was patient, being dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With darkened eyelids, and their lashes yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his late sobbing wet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, with moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing away his tears, left others of my own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, on a table drawn beside his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had put, within his reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A box of counters and a red-vein’d stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A piece of glass abraded by the beach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_912" id="page_912">{912}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And six or seven shells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bottle with bluebells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort his sad heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when that night I pray’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God, I wept, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, when at last we lie with trancèd breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not vexing Thee in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thou rememberest of what toys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We made our joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How weakly understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy great commanded good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, fatherly not less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou’lt leave Thy wrath, and say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘I will be sorry for their childishness.’<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the one darling of our widowhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nursling Grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no dews blur our eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the peach-bloom come in evening skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance we may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now this night is day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even through faith of still averted feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making full circle of our banishment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazèd meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitter journey to the bourne so sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seasoning the termless feast of our content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tears of recognition never dry.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The bed of state is hung with crape&mdash;the grand old bed where she was wed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like an upright corpse she sitteth gazing dumbly at the bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hour by hour her serving-men enter by the curtain’d door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with steps of muffled woe pass breathless o’er the silent floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marshal mutely round, and look from each to each with eyelids red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Touch him not,’ she shriek’d and cried, ‘he is but newly dead!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘O my own dear mistress,’ the ancient Nurse did say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Seven long days and seven long nights you have watch’d him where he lay.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Seven long days and seven long nights,‘the hoary Steward said;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">‘Seven,’ said the old Henchman, and bow’d his aged head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘On your lives!’ she shriek’d and cried,‘he is but newly dead!’<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Then a father Priest they sought,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">‘For she is mild and sweet of will,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">She loved him, and his words are peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And he shall heal her ill.’<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But her watch she did not cease.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He bless’d her where she sat distraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And show’d her holy cross,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The cross she kiss’d from year to year<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_919" id="page_919">{919}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But she neither saw nor heard;<br /></span>

<span class="i6">All he had been wont to teach,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">All she had been fond to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Missall’d prayer, and solemn speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But she answer’d not a word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only when he turn’d to speak with those who wept about the bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘On your lives!’ she shriek’d and cried, ‘he is but newly dead!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then how sadly he turn’d from her, it were wonderful to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stood beside the death-bed as by one who slumbers well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he lean’d o’er him who lay there, and in cautious whisper low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘He is not dead, but sleepeth,’ said the Priest, and smooth’d his brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Sleepeth?’ said she, looking up, and the sun rose in her face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘He must be better than I thought, for the sleep is very sound.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘He is better,’ said the Priest, and call’d her maidens round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them came that ancient dame who nursed her when a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Nurse!’ she sigh’d, ‘O Nurse!’ she cried, ‘O Nurse!’ and then she smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And then she wept; with that they drew<br /></span>
<span class="i6">About her, as of old;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Her dying eyes were sweet and blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Her trembling touch was cold;<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Let them kill the feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">I would be happy in my soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">“He is better,” saith the Priest;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He did but sleep the weary day,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And will waken whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_920" id="page_920">{920}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i6">Carry me to his dear side,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And let the halls be trim;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Whistly, whistly,’ said she,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">‘I am wan with watching and wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">He must not wake to see me pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Let me sleep with him.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">See you keep the tryst for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">I would rest till he awake<br /></span>

<span class="i6">‘Yet rejoice your Lord doth live;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And for His dear sake<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Say <i>Laus, Domine</i>.’<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Silent they cast down their eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And every breast a sob did rive,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">She lifted her in wild surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And they dared not disobey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘<i>Laus Deo</i>,’ said the Steward, hoary when her days were new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘<i>Laus Deo</i>,’ said the Warrener, whiter than the warren snows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘<i>Laus Deo</i>,’ the bald Henchman, who had nursed her on his knee.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The old Nurse moved her lips in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And she stood among the train<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Like a dead tree shaking dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Then the Priest he softly slept<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Midway in the little band,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And he took the Lady’s hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">‘<i>Laus Deo</i>,’ he said aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">‘<i>Laus Deo</i>,’ they said again,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Yet again, and yet again,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Humbly cross’d and lowly bow’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Till in wont and fear it rose<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To the Sabbath strain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_921" id="page_921">{921}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i6">But she neither turn’d her head<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Nor ‘Whistly, whistly,’ said she.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Her hands were folded as in grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">We laid her with her ancient race<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And all the village wept.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Lies my young love sleeping in the shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I the heart to slide an arm beneath her,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Strange her eyes; her cheeks are cold as cold sea-shells.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Chill as a dull face frowning on a song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, but shows the South-west a ripple-feather’d bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scaling the mid-heavens as they stream, there comes a sunset<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rich, deep like love in beauty without end.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">. . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When at dawn she sighs, and like an infant to the window<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Turns grave eyes craving light, released from dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful she looks, like a white water-lily<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bursting out of bud in havens of the streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful she looks, like a tall garden-lily<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pure from the night, and splendid for the day.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mother of the dews, dark eye-lash’d twilight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Low-lidded twilight, o’er the valley’s brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rounding on thy breast sings the dew-delighted skylark,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden where the rose-flush drinks the rayless planet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fountain-full he pours the spraying fountain-showers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me hear her laughter, I would have her ever<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cool as dew in twilight, the lark above the flowers.<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_932" id="page_932">{932}</a></span>
<span class="i8">. . .<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Up lanes, woods through, they troop in joyful bands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sweet leads: she knows not why, but now she loiters,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Eyes the bent anemones, and hangs her hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a look will tell that the violets are peeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Coming the rose: and unaware a cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Springs in her bosom for odours and for colour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Covert and the nightingale; she knows not why.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">. . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kerchief’d head and chin she darts between her tulips,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Streaming like a willow gray in arrowy rain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bend beaten cheek to gravel, and their angel<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She will be; she lifts them, and on she speeds again.<br /></span>

Built thee fair cities for thy naked plains:<br />
How hast thou set thy summer growth among<br />
The broken stones which were their palaces!<br />
Hast thou forgot the darkness where <i>he</i> lies<br />
Who made thee beautiful, or have thy bees<br />
Found out his grave to build their honeycombs?<br />

O world, in very truth thou art too young:<br />

Who made a festival and straightway hung<br />

Hast thou forgot the glory of those eyes<br />
Which first look'd love in thine? Thou hast not furl'd<br />
One banner of thy bridal car for them.<br />
  O world, in very truth thou art too young.<br />
There was a voice which sang about thy spring,<br />
Till winter froze the sweetness of his lips,<br />
And lo, the worms had hardly left his tongue<br />
Before thy nightingales were come again.<br />
O world, what courage hast thou thus to sing?<br />
Say, has thy merriment no secret pain,<br />
No sudden weariness that thou art young?<br />

<span class="i0">That blaze in the velvet blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’re all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">We’re steaming all too slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it’s twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the trumpet-orchids blow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have heard the call of the off-shore wind<br /></span>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
